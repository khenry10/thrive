## Technical Requirements
​
**Performing**: nice work adding in 3 models here! users, litss, and tags, great job. I'd encourage you to keep pushing this and take it a little further! Maybe think about a "favorites" tag, or "frequently used"? Or, using some sort of external API for grocery prices?
​
## Creativity and Interface
​
**Performing**: Wow your CSS has come a long way already! Some really nice work here. I'd encourage you to also start focusing on the responsiveness of the app when changing sizes. Mobile is a big thing! One of the easiest ways to start that is to start moving away from using 'px', and instead using 'em' and '%'s.
​
## Code Quality
​
**Performing**: Love the use of the model method! That's a great step in the right direction. I've also added in some comments, specifically in the controllers and view files, that should help give you some ideas for DRYing it up and cleaning some other parts to be more conventional. Most importantly is to try to avoid using classes in your views (List.where, etc).
​
## Deployment and Functionality
​
**Performing**: Great job here Keith! This looks really good. Super impressed with the checkbox finally working, yay!
​
## Planning / Process / Submission
​
**Excelling**: Really nice job with user stories and wireframing. And I especially like the README with installation and technology write-ups. One note, make sure to include rake commands as well, or else localhost won't for for others!
