- As a user, I want to be able to create multiple, separate lists of related things to help me track and remember what I need to do
- As a user I want to be able to create lists of tasks I need to accomplish
- As a user I want to be able to track how much time I spend on individual tasks and on the total list
- As a user I want to be able to create lists of things I need to buy
- As a user I want to be able to track how much each item costs and how much ($) is included in the total list
- As a user I want to be able to save lists and set to different recurring intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
    - Example: I want to save the common items (lets say 10 things) I always have on my grocery list and set the list to occur every week.  After I go grocery shopping on Saturday, I want next weeks list to be created and to have the 10 items I saved on it.  
- As a user I want to be able to see EVERYTHING that I have logged on every list I have created
